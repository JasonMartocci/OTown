Synopsis:

Make a health portal that takes the edamam, yelp and google api and from your geo location retrieves data about Recipe Search, Restraunt Search, BMI calculator, Nutritional Value Search, and Organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Kosher foods, Health Clubs and Coupons. Problem: People have to go to multiple locations to gather this information, the website condenses the information, saves time, and is very useful to vegans and visitors who are new to a city or traveling for work.

Solution: Creating one location to get information on various health topics.
